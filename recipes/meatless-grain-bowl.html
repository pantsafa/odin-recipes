    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white rice</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 large sweet potato, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil or vegetable oil, or as needed, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 green bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 orange bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package extra firm tofu</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon jerk seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons jerk marinade</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Keep warm.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Toss cubed sweet potatoes in 1 tablespoon oil. Spread evenly on a baking sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Roast sweet potatoes in the preheated oven until tender but not too soft, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Heat a cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon coconut oil over medium-high heat; add red, green, and orange bell peppers and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Add remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil to the same skillet. Add tofu evenly. Cook for 2 minutes and gently flip to the other side. Continue cooking, turning occasionally, until tofu gets a little crisp on the edges, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Add jerk marinade, being deliberate about making sure tofu is covered. Once tofu starts to caramelize from the marinade, remove from heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Warm black beans in a microwave-safe dish until hot, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.</p>

    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>Assemble grain bowls: divide rice, tofu, peppers, sweet potatoes, and black beans evenly into individual serving bowls.</p>
